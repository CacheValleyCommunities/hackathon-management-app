                Code Camp is a programming, design and entrepreneurship contest all rolled up into a ridiculously
                compressed 24-hour event. It's crazy fun! Teams ranging in size from one to four participants compete
                against other teams to build the best web or mobile app.

                Divisions</h2>
            <p class="mb-12 text-gray-700">
                Code Camp features multiple divisions. The division your team competes in is dependent on the individual
                with the highest level of experience. For example, if your team of four people is a Novice, two
                Collegiate, and one Industry (professional), then your team competes in the Industry Division.

                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                        Industry teams include at least ONE professional. A professional is someone that either is
                        currently working full-time as a programmer, designer, project manager; someone who has been
                        paid for their development work, or has been an intern (paid or unpaid) for more than two years.
                        Teams in this Division are developing company ideas, side projects to test concepts or simply to
                        just claim bragging rights.

                        Intermediate participants have experience in the industry but have not worked professionally
                        (paid for work). Teams in this Division are looking to improve their software development skills
                        and impress potential employers. Intermediate participants are typically late stage high-school
                        students, college students, or someone of an equal experience level.

                        learn new skills and techniques. Novices have some programming or coding experience. Novices are
                        participants with some programming experience (high-school students, first-year college
                        students, or someone with little to no background in programming or software development).

                You! If you are (or are aspiring to be) a programmer, designer, entrepreneur, project manager,

            <p class="mb-6 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Aside from getting a rad Code Camp t-shirt, you'll have perhaps the best opportunity of the year to
                bring your skill-set to new heights. There is nothing as exhilarating (and perhaps humbling) as trying
                to build something meaningful (e.g. and something that works) in just a 24-hour window.

            <p class="mb-12 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Past years' participants have deepened relationships with colleagues, found jobs or business partners,
                launched successful businesses, formed new friends, built new networks, and made lasting memories. If
                this sounds too good to be true, we dare you to come participate and prove us wrong 😉

                Originate?</h2>
            <p class="mb-12 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                The first code camp was in 2010. The idea was originally conceived by Jerry Brown of OveractDev and Jill
                Elliss of USTAR at the Business Resource Center. Since then, an active board of volunteers has evolved
                Code Camp into a highly-anticipated, sponsor-funded event that is gaining both popularity and
                recognition across the region. Code Camp wouldn't be possible if it wasn't for our generous sponsors and
                dedicated organizers.
